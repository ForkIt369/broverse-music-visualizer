3. **Particles**: Physics-based movement with band-specific forces
4. **DNA Helix**: 3D transforms with frequency modulation
5. **Radial Pulse**: Multi-band response with peak tracking
6. **Grid Matrix**: Wave propagation with intensity mapping

### ðŸŽ® User Experience

#### Preset System
- **Chill**: Low sensitivity (0.6), high smoothing (0.95)
- **Party**: High sensitivity (1.4), medium smoothing (0.8)
- **Focus**: Balanced sensitivity (1.0), smooth (0.9)
- **Hype**: Maximum sensitivity (1.8), fast response (0.7)

#### Avatar Expression Engine
- Smooth intensity morphing
- Expression cooldown prevents rapid changes
- Scale and rotation based on intensity
- Beat-synchronized "vibing" animation
- Dynamic glow color based on mood

### ðŸ“Š Technical Specifications

#### Audio Processing

- Async/await for asset loading
- Proper error handling
- Memory cleanup (URL.revokeObjectURL)
- Event listener management

#### Maintainability
- Clear method naming
- Separated concerns (DOM, Audio, Visualization)
- Configurable settings object
- Reusable helper classes (BeatDetector)
